Uncertainty replicates the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle using matplotlib.


~~ A non-physicist's take one the uncertainty principal~~
(Probably wrong but close enough)

The values of position and velocity are undefined for all quantum particles.

All particles are shown as waves. Peaks represent position and the distance between peaks represents velocity.

A single wave (a sine wave) has clearly defined peak distance, but has positions defined for all of space.

Adding multiple waves causes some peaks to be higher, revealing more information about position, but removing information about velocity.

As an infinite amount of waves are added together, position becomes very clear but all information about momentum is destroyed.

Thus, as more information is known about one, the less is known about the other.
